# SpellPunk

## Welcome
Welcome to the world of **SpellPunk**, mysterious traveller. In these lands, merely decades ago, a seemingly apocalyptic and most curious event occurred, the **Connection**. Otherworldly entities started manifesting into our world, or rather, it was our worlds entire that *"connected"*, shattering the natural order as we knew it, throwing the world in an unbalanced state in which **Punks** rule, roam, and roar.
  
If you wish to read a systematic description of this world, you can proceed to the **ðŸ“š Lore**.

## ðŸ“š Lore

### Stats
Every character is somewhat defined by 3 main statistics, Body, Mind, and Soul. Each of them affects 3 derived statistics, which are the numbers that will most often be used to determine a character's success or failure for a task. The stats and derived stats work as follows:

**ðŸ’ª Body**

- **Attack:** Enhances hit rate and damage dealt.

- **Defense:** Enhances dodge/block rate and minimises damage taken.

- **Prowess:** Affects maneuvers, resistance to physical deprivations and to critical hits, and inventory space.

**ðŸ§  Mind**

- **Speed:** Determines the speed in and out of combat, the likelihood of successful fleeing, and the chance of critical hits.

- **Craft:** Increases the quality of crafted items and the ability to lockpick.

- **Energy:** Determines how many supernatural actions one can perform.

**ðŸŒ€ Soul**

- **Aura:** Determines whether one hits or gets hit by a supernatural effect, dealing or taking difference as damage, if any.

- **Connection:** Determines the likelihood to elude death and to save Experience Points when they should have been spent or lost.

- **Fate:** Determines the likelihood to inspire emotions in creatures and to earn more rewarding loot.

### Races
Humans developed Supernatural abilities, and their offspring seldom manifested a closer contact to the Otherworlds than their parents, giving rise to a whole new concept of Races which, as of now, we aggregate into a few thematic groups. All races have the looks of a human, at most with accentuated features, such as uncommonly hairy, eyes of a peculiar colour, particularly sharp canines, slightly off skin complexion, etc.

**ðŸ§‘ Human**

A Human is not just a human anymore. Ever since the Connection, many started developing some kind of ability or power, without straying too far away from their humanity. Ingenious, curious, and resourceful, humans are fast-learners who leverage their many experiences to flexibly overcome difficulties.

Bonus to: Experience Points Gained

**ðŸ©¸ Halve**

A Halve is a person who is only half human. The other half? Anything with a similar life-cycle! Half-Orcs, Half-Elves, Half-Beasts, etc. Half-Bloods are usually more in touch with nature, have stronger bodies and instincts, and enjoy a more flexible perspective on life.

Bonus to: Body and Soul

**ðŸ’‰ Synth**

A Synth is any artificial, organic, living replica of a human. Similarly to a modern Frankenstein, or to a mutant created in a lab, Synths are engineered to overcome human weaknesses, with bodies and minds that tend to be sharper than those of the average human.

Bonus to: Body and Mind

**ðŸ‘¤ Shade**

A Shade is any person whose life is somewhat intertwined with entities beyond the human world. Touched by the Otherworlds, their heritages and powers come from Djinns, Spectres, Fairies, Mermaids, etc. Shades tend to be more aware, both of the world and of themselves.

Bonus to: Mind and Soul
